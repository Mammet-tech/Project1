            <h1>The Lens of Memory</h1>
            <p class="paragraph">"Through the lens, we capture not just images but emotions, memories, and stories that
                last a lifetime.
                Welcome to The Lens of Memory, where each photo tells a tale, each frame holds a feeling, and every
                moment is preserved for eternity.
                Step into a world of artistry and see life as I, Mammet, experience it—one photograph at a time."

            <p class="paragraph">"Hi, I’m Mammet, a storyteller who believes in the power of photography to capture
                life’s most
                meaningful moments. While I’m not a photographer, I’ve always been inspired by how a single
                image
                can
                evoke emotions and tell a story that words cannot. This website is my way of sharing the beauty
                and
                memories I cherish, seen through the lens of talented photographers and curated with love.
                Welcome
                to
                The Lens of Memory, where every photo has a story waiting to be discovered."
